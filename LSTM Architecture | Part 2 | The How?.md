like ct and ht, the shape of ft, it, ct_bar(CANDIDATE CELL STATE {`IT CONTAINS THE INFO. WHICH MIGHT BE THE CANDIDATE OF LTM`}) and t_o (WILL ALWAYS BE SAME) according to NO. OF HIDDEN UNITS

TO PERFORM tanh, PUT EACH NUMBER IN tanh TO CALCULATE IT
* `here we have taken c_t-1 as an example to show how to perform tanh operation`

# **yellow boxes**
* `they are hidden layers with nodes (NUMBER OF NODES IS A HYPERPARAM. & ALL THE HIDDEN LAYERS (THESE 4 BOXES) SHOULD HAVE SAME NUMBER OF NODES) and sigma & tanh shows activation functions here`
